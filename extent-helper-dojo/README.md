#ArcGIS API for JavaScript Extent Helper

* [Live Sample](http://bsnider.github.io/web-javascript/extent-helper/index.html)

This tool is designed to help determine Web Mercator and Geographic extents for constructing new maps.

## Features

* written in AMD
* uses version 3.14 of the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), but should be able to be upgraded conveniently.
* inspired by [@noashx's](http://github.com/noashx) [Extent helper sample](http://noashx.github.io/) and Esri's [Flex Extent Helper](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapps/flexviewer/extenthelper/flexviewer_extenthelper.html)

NOTE: Please submit pull requests/issues to update to this sample.  I am always looking for ways to make this sample as useful as possible.
